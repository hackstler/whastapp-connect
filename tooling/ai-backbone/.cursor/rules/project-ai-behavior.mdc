# AI Behavior

## Output Language

- All code in English
- Responses to the user in Spanish
- NEVER add code comments in Spanish
- NEVER add comments that narrate what the code does — only explain non-obvious intent

## Code Generation

- Apply SOLID, KISS, DRY, YAGNI at all times
- Use TypeScript strict mode patterns: `infer`, `keyof`, mapped types
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- No default exports — named exports only
- Never generate test files, ESLint configs, or boilerplate unless explicitly requested

## Forbidden in Generated Code

- `any` types
- `console.log` (use project logger)
- Hardcoded secrets or URLs
- `enum` (use `as const` unions)
- Comments that explain what the code does (only why)
